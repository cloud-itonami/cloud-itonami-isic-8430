  "SocialSecurityActor — the ISIC Rev.5 8430 compulsory social security
  administration actor as a `langgraph.graph/state-graph` (per ADR-2607011000
  / CLAUDE.md Actors section). One graph run = one benefits administration
  operation request (intake → advise → govern → decide → commit/hold, with
  a human-approval interrupt for escalated proposals). No infinite internal
  loop; checkpointed per superstep so an interrupted run can resume after
  human sign-off.

  ```text
  :intake -> :advise -> :govern -> :decide -+-> :commit           (:ok? true)
                                             +-> :request-approval  (:escalate? true, interrupt-before)
                                             +-> :hold              (:hard? true)
  ```

  The unconditional invariant: the SocialSecurityAdvisor can never directly
  commit a record or dispatch a robot action the SocialSecurityGovernor
  refuses — every commit-record! call is gated behind `:decide`. Additionally,
  any proposal touching benefit approval/denial, payment disbursement,
  or payment modification PERMANENTLY HOLDS (no path to approval)."
